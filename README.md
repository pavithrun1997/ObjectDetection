ObjectDetection based on color filtering

This is project where i tested out object detection without using any fancy deep learning techniques instead did it with the help of color filerting technique.

The given script ouff the shelf will work for yellow colored object detection. For object detection of othe colors just chnage the hue based color limit of the object which is meant for object detection.

A video file is also present along with this repo which helps you to get started with object detection once you download the entire repo.

Hope its helpful !!!
